# GF2Excel-Addon
This Gravity Forms AddOn saves form data into a given Excel document and attaches it to notification emails.

To know more about it, just access the plugin's page on [wordpress.org](https://br.wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-to-excel-addon/).

Obs.: I am not the owner of this package, I just fixed an error and put it on github to share with the community.
